# Network namespaces

**Namespaces and cgroups** are two of the main kernel technologies most of the new trend on software containerization (think Docker) rides on.

**cgroups** are a metering and limiting mechanism, they control how much of a system resource (CPU, memory) you can use. 

**namespaces** limit what you can see. Thanks to namespaces processes have their own view of the systemâ€™s resources.

## Types of namespaces: 
The Linux kernel provides 6 types of namespaces: 
**pid, net, mnt, uts, ipc and user**. 

For instance, a process inside a pid namespace only sees processes in the same namespace. 
Thanks to the mnt namespace, itâ€™s possible to attach a process to its own filesystem (like chroot).

### PID Namespace

### Network Namespace 
ðŸ‘‰ Network namespaces provide a brand-new network stack for all the processes within the namespace. That includes network interfaces, routing tables and iptables rules.
