# DNS Naming

>In docker environment, ip addresses are not reliable.

👉 **This is because a container may crash/stop unexpectedly and then a new container takes it’s place with a different ip.
So how do we ensure communication in such a situation?**

***Most Important Points***
- This is where a **DNS naming** comes in. Docker by default uses container names as host names which can be used by containers to talk to each other.
- ☝️ This is only true for user created networks. Default bridge network doesn’t have this feature

## Difference between user created network Vs Default bridge network
1. **User-defined bridges provide automatic DNS resolution between containers**
2. **User-defined bridges provide better isolation.**

   All containers without a --network specified, are attached to the default bridge network. This can be a risk, as unrelated stacks/services/containers are then able to communicate.

   Using a user-defined network provides a scoped network in which only containers attached to that network are able to communicate.
3.**Containers can be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly**

If your containers use the default bridge network, you can configure it, but all the containers use the same settings, such as MTU and iptables rules. In addition, configuring the default bridge network happens outside of Docker itself, and requires a restart of Docker.

User-defined bridge networks are created and configured using docker network create. If different groups of applications have different network requirements, you can configure each user-defined bridge separately, as you create it.
