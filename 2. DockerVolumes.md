# Discuss more on Volumes

Volumes help to make things persistent. In simple words, any data wonâ€™t be bound to the container and would be saved on the hostâ€™s file system.
There are three types of volumes:
          1. host          
          2. anonymous, and 
          3. named

ðŸ‘‰ A **host volume** lives on the Docker hostâ€™s filesystem and can be accessed from within the container and are also called bind mounts.

```Dockerfile
$ docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container ...
```
ðŸ‘‰ An anonymous volume is useful for when you would rather have Docker handle where the files are stored. It can be difficult, however, to refer to the same volume over time when it is an anonymous volume. 
To create an anonymous volume:

```Dockerfile
$ docker run -v /path/in/container ...
```

ðŸ‘‰ A named volume is similar to an anonymous volume. Docker manages where on disk the volume is created, but you give it a volume name. To create a named volume:

```Dockerfile
Option 1: docker volume create somevolumename 
Option 2: docker run -v name:/path/in/container ... 
```

## Creating and testing a Bind mount:

1. Run the following command, to mount hostâ€™s /var/log/serverlogs/ at place of /var/log/nignx/ directory of the container.
   ðŸ‘‰ Note: If the directory doesnâ€™t exist, it will be created.
   
   ```dockerfile
   $ docker container run -p 8180:80 -d -v /var/log/serverlogs:/var/log/nginx nginx
    //Output
    76f44df2208c1bccae1078b3bd0c53855d3732b0768e4546532fdbe70710cc7d
   ```
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8180 to ensure it works fine.
3. Refresh a few times so that Nginx creates a few access logs.
4. Check logs in the host directory /var/log/serverlogs.
   ```Dockerfile
   $ cat /var/log/serverlogs/access.log
     //Output
     172.17.0.1 - - [31/Jan/2020:10:16:43 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 555 "http://localhost:8180/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130 Safari/537.36" "-"
     ... output truncated
   ```
5. Stop the container and start a new one and ensure all logs are present, even from the old container.
6. Remember to refresh a few times on http://localhost:8180 to create new logs.

```Dockerfile
$ docker container stop 76f //stop the running container
$ docker container run -p 8180:80 -d -v /var/log/serverlogs:/var/log/nginx nginx // start a new container
//Output
d644392705acd28fd4ff5088e52777ef421d88266435da94da8050a20672967e
$ cat /var/log/serverlogs/access.log
//Output from old container
172.17.0.1 - - [31/Jan/2020:10:16:43 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 555 "http://localhost:8180/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130 Safari/537.36" "-"

//Output from new container
172.17.0.1 - - [31/Jan/2020:10:21:17 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 304 0 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130 Safari/537.36" "-"
```

***Congratulations!! You have successfully set up reliable logging independent of lifespan of containers.***

## What are anonymous and named volumes:
As we have seen in the above To create an anonymous volume, run:

```Dockerfile
docker run -v /path/in/container ...
```
- First letâ€™s take a look at mysql [Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/blob/3dfa7a3c038f342b9dec09fa85247bef69ae2349/8.0/Dockerfile), you will notice it already   uses volume for /var/lib/mysql
  
  ```Dockerfile
  VOLUME /var/lib/mysql  //from the dockerfile
  ```
Docker commands:

```bash
docker pull mysql

docker run --name myDatabase -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql

//Enter the conatiner and start mysql
docker exec -it 64b mysql -u root -p
```
It will prompt for a password. Use the same one you used to run the container.
We have successfully started a mysql container:)

Now create a databse called app and populate the same.

***Launching another SQL container***

Mysql containers use docker volumes. So the new container should have access to the persisted data.
If you start a second container on the same machine, ideally it should bind to the same volume.

Letâ€™s try it out and see if that really happens.

```bash
docker run --name myDatabase2 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql
//Output
e905312e2a6029a95484116715826b635315e868d1014ea6ef1099dbb9cab97a
```

**Let us see if we see the same data as both the containers share the same volume as you saw in Dockerfile, which is VOLUME /var/lib/mysql**

```bash
docker exec -it e90 mysql -u root -p
//Run the following commands once you established a mysql session
mysql> use app;
ERROR 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'app'

```
ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ˜• ***We are also using volumes so why are we not seeing the data?***

Let us confirm both the containers are using volumes by running docker inspect <container-id>
          
```bash
docker inspect e90
//Output
...
"Mounts": [
            {

            }
        ],
...
docker inspect 64b

            {

                "Propagation": ""
            }
        ],
...

```
          
#### The key thing to note here is even though the destination directories same, the source directories are different.

Although the volume points to the same folder inside the container, on the host system, since weâ€™ve not explicitly assigned a folder, it creates a unique folder in the docker volumes directory.

>These are anonymous volumes and are created and managed by docker.
>Note : They are stored here /var/lib/docker/volumes

ðŸ‘‰ ***So how do we ensure all our mysql containers have access to the same data?***
          
**Answer is: Named Volumes**
