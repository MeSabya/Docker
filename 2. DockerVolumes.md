# Discuss more on Volumes

Volumes help to make things persistent. In simple words, any data wonâ€™t be bound to the container and would be saved on the hostâ€™s file system.
There are three types of volumes:
          1. host          
          2. anonymous, and 
          3. named

ðŸ‘‰ A **host volume** lives on the Docker hostâ€™s filesystem and can be accessed from within the container and are also called bind mounts.

```Dockerfile
$ docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container ...
```
ðŸ‘‰ An anonymous volume is useful for when you would rather have Docker handle where the files are stored. It can be difficult, however, to refer to the same volume over time when it is an anonymous volume. 
To create an anonymous volume:

```Dockerfile
$ docker run -v /path/in/container ...
```

ðŸ‘‰ A named volume is similar to an anonymous volume. Docker manages where on disk the volume is created, but you give it a volume name. To create a named volume:

```Dockerfile
Option 1: docker volume create somevolumename 
Option 2: docker run -v name:/path/in/container ... 
```

## Creating and testing a Bind mount:

1. Run the following command, to mount hostâ€™s /var/log/serverlogs/ at place of /var/log/nignx/ directory of the container.
   ðŸ‘‰ Note: If the directory doesnâ€™t exist, it will be created.
   
   ```dockerfile
   $ docker container run -p 8180:80 -d -v /var/log/serverlogs:/var/log/nginx nginx
    //Output
    76f44df2208c1bccae1078b3bd0c53855d3732b0768e4546532fdbe70710cc7d
   ```
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8180 to ensure it works fine.
3. Refresh a few times so that Nginx creates a few access logs.
4. Check logs in the host directory /var/log/serverlogs.
   ```Dockerfile
   $ cat /var/log/serverlogs/access.log
     //Output
     172.17.0.1 - - [31/Jan/2020:10:16:43 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 555 "http://localhost:8180/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130 Safari/537.36" "-"
     ... output truncated
   ```
5. Stop the container and start a new one and ensure all logs are present, even from the old container.
6. Remember to refresh a few times on http://localhost:8180 to create new logs.

```Dockerfile
$ docker container stop 76f //stop the running container
$ docker container run -p 8180:80 -d -v /var/log/serverlogs:/var/log/nginx nginx // start a new container
//Output
d644392705acd28fd4ff5088e52777ef421d88266435da94da8050a20672967e
$ cat /var/log/serverlogs/access.log
//Output from old container
172.17.0.1 - - [31/Jan/2020:10:16:43 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 555 "http://localhost:8180/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130 Safari/537.36" "-"

//Output from new container
172.17.0.1 - - [31/Jan/2020:10:21:17 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 304 0 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130 Safari/537.36" "-"
```

***Congratulations!! You have successfully set up reliable logging independent of lifespan of containers.***
